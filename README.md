# Slackoverflow
- Students have trouble with programming bugs
    + *Stack Overflow?* SO is purposefully daunting to post a question on, and
      questions can be answered more quickly/thorougly if someone understands
      the context in which it exists (better to ask at MS if MS curriculum)
    + *TAs?* But they're constantly busy, have to have set hours, and can be 
      difficult to find. 
    + *Instructors?* See above, and sometimes a person may have a question that
      they feel would make them appear as lacking x in front of an intructor
    + *Peers?* But you have to bother them, and they're still learning, so the
      answers they provide may not be based in accurate or thorough 
      understanding
    + *Google?* But sometimes the resources online are not adapted for someone 
      who is trying to build an understanding and assumes pre-requisite 
      knowledge.
- Students have questions on policy regarding/procedure at Make School
- Most people have similar questions (assumption) 
    + For some tutorials, since students are following the same reference
      material, they often run into the same issues
    + TAs/RAs/Staff/Instructors repeat a lot of effort and lose time
- All Students/Intructors/Staff are on Slack
- Slack can be accessed from anywhere/anytime with an Internet connection
